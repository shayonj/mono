/**
 * Upstream-agnostic dispatch of messages in a {@link ChangeStreamMessage} to a
 * {@link Forwarder} and {@link Storer} to execute the forward-store-ack
 * procedure described in {@link ChangeStreamer}.
 *
 * ### Subscriber Catchup
 *
 * Connecting clients first need to be "caught up" to the current watermark
 * (from stored change log entries) before new entries are forwarded to
 * them. This is non-trivial because the replication stream may be in the
 * middle of a pending streamed Transaction for which some entries have
 * already been forwarded but are not yet committed to the store.
 *
 *
 * ```
 * ------------------------------- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 * | Historic changes in storage |  Pending (streamed) tx  |   Next tx
 * ------------------------------- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 *                                           Replication stream
 *                                           >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >
 *           ^  ---> required catchup --->   ^
 * Subscriber watermark               Subscription begins
 * ```
 *
 * Preemptively buffering the changes of every pending transaction
 * would be wasteful and consume too much memory for large transactions.
 *
 * Instead, the streamer synchronously dispatches changes and subscriptions
 * to the {@link Forwarder} and the {@link Storer} such that the two
 * components are aligned as to where in the stream the subscription started.
 * The two components then coordinate catchup and handoff via the
 * {@link Subscriber} object with the following algorithm:
 *
 * * If the streamer is in the middle of a pending Transaction, the
 *   Subscriber is "queued" on both the Forwarder and the Storer. In this
 *   state, new changes are *not* forwarded to the Subscriber, and catchup
 *   is not yet executed.
 * * Once the commit message for the pending Transaction is processed
 *   by the Storer, it begins catchup on the Subscriber (with a READONLY
 *   snapshot so that it does not block subsequent storage operations).
 *   This catchup is thus guaranteed to load the change log entries of
 *   that last Transaction.
 * * When the Forwarder processes that same commit message, it moves the
 *   Subscriber from the "queued" to the "active" set of clients such that
 *   the Subscriber begins receiving new changes, starting from the next
 *   Transaction.
 * * The Subscriber does not forward those changes, however, if its catchup
 *   is not complete. Until then, it buffers the changes in memory.
 * * Once catchup is complete, the buffered changes are immediately sent
 *   and the Subscriber henceforth forwards changes as they are received.
 *
 * In the (common) case where the streamer is not in the middle of a pending
 * transaction when a subscription begins, the Storer begins catchup
 * immediately and the Forwarder directly adds the Subscriber to its active
 * set. However, the Subscriber still buffers any forwarded messages until
 * its catchup is complete.
 *
 * ### Watermarks and ordering
 *
 * The ChangeStreamerService depends on its {@link ChangeSource} to send
 * changes in contiguous [`begin`, `data` ..., `data`, `commit`] sequences
 * in commit order. This follows Postgres's Logical Replication Protocol
 * Message Flow:
 *
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/protocol-logical-replication.html#PROTOCOL-LOGICAL-MESSAGES-FLOW
 *
 * > The logical replication protocol sends individual transactions one by one.
 * > This means that all messages between a pair of Begin and Commit messages belong to the same transaction.
 *
 * In order to correctly replay (new) and filter (old) messages to subscribers
 * at different points in the replication stream, these changes must be assigned
 * watermarks such that they preserve the order in which they were received
 * from the ChangeSource.
 *
 * A previous implementation incorrectly derived these watermarks from the Postgres
 * Log Sequence Numbers (LSN) of each message. However, LSNs from concurrent,
 * non-conflicting transactions can overlap, which can result in a `begin` message
 * with an earlier LSN arriving after a `commit` message. For example, the
 * changes for these transactions:
 *
 * ```
 * LSN:   1     2     3  4    5   6   7     8   9      10
 * tx1: begin  data     data     data     commit
 * tx2:             begin    data    data      data  commit
 * ```
 *
 * will arrive as:
 *
 * ```
 * begin1, data2, data4, data6, commit8, begin3, data5, data7, data9, commit10
 * ```
 *
 * Thus, LSN of non-commit messages are not suitable for tracking the sorting
 * order of the replication stream.
 *
 * Instead, the ChangeStreamer uses the following algorithm for deterministic
 * catchup and filtering of changes:
 *
 * * A `commit` message is assigned to a watermark corresponding to its LSN.
 *   These are guaranteed to be in commit order by definition.
 *
 * * `begin` and `data` messages are assigned to the watermark of the
 *   preceding `commit` (the previous transaction, or the replication
 *   slot's starting LSN) plus 1. This guarantees that they will be sorted
 *   after the previously commit transaction even if their LSNs came before it.
 *   This is referred to as the `preCommitWatermark`.
 *
 * * In the ChangeLog DB, messages have a secondary sort column `pos`, which is
 *   the position of the message within its transaction, with the `begin` message
 *   starting at `0`. This guarantees that `begin` and `data` messages will be
 *   fetched in the original ChangeSource order during catchup.
 *
 * `begin` and `data` messages share the same watermark, but this is sufficient for
 * Subscriber filtering because subscribers only know about the `commit` watermarks
 * exposed in the `Downstream` `Commit` message. The Subscriber object thus compares
 * the internal watermarks of the incoming messages against the commit watermark of
 * the caller, updating the watermark at every `Commit` message that is forwarded.
 *
 * ### Cleanup
 *
 * As mentioned in the {@link ChangeStreamer} documentation: "the ChangeStreamer
 * uses a combination of [the "initial", i.e. backup-derived watermark and] ACK
 * responses from connected subscribers to determine the watermark up
 * to which it is safe to purge old change log entries."
 *
 * More concretely:
 *
 * * The `initial`, backup-derived watermark is the earliest to which cleanup
 *   should ever happen.
 *
 * * However, it is possible for the replica backup to be *ahead* of a connected
 *   subscriber; and if a network error causes that subscriber to retry from its
 *   last watermark, the change streamer must support it.
 *
 * Thus, before cleaning up to an `initial` backup-derived watermark, the change
 * streamer first confirms that all connected subscribers have also passed
 * that watermark.

// The delay between receiving an initial, backup-based watermark

// This delay should be long enough to handle situations like the following:
//
// 1. `litestream restore` downloads a backup for the `replication-manager`
// 2. `replication-manager` starts up and runs this `change-streamer`
// 3. `zero-cache`s that are running on a different replica connect to this
//    `change-streamer` after exponential backoff retries.
//
// It is possible for a `zero-cache`[3] to be behind the backup restored [1].
// This cleanup delay (30 seconds) is thus set to be a value comfortably
// longer than the max delay for exponential backoff (10 seconds) in
// `services/running-state.ts`. This allows the `zero-cache` [3] to reconnect
// so that the `change-streamer` can track its progress and know when it has
// surpassed the initial watermark of the backup [1].
